            <p>
                In 2024, I was successful in my application to become a Director in the UNSW 
                Engineering Society's Programs Portfolio. The director team has full 
                control of the vision and execution of EngSoc's programs, which include Applied 
                Consulting for Engineers (ACE) and Peer Mentoring. We liase with our industry sponsors,
                host workshops, organise catering, conduct interviews and are responsible for the general smooth
                running of events. I am in charge of coordinating with the IT porfolio to set out the 
                requirements for our Peer Mentoring website, and I oversee the database, hosted on firebase. This has
                given me valuable backend experience.

                Before I was a Programs Director, I was part of the Programs Subcommitte. I contributed 
                to all the same programs under the direction of the 2023 Programs directors. I presented 
                workshops as part of the now defunct Engineering Upskilling Program (EUP), where I taught 
                students soft skills such as presentation and teamwork. At the end of the year, I was in charge 
                of hosting a charity day to raise money and awareness for Engineers Without Borders (EWB).
